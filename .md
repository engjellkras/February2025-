## â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.

<p>- One-Way function is really important in Cryptography. They are easy to compute, but really hard to
reverse. Good analogy used was that they are like breaking a plate. Its easy to break it, but hard to fix.
The thing is that mathematically, these one way functions may not even exist. That why ususally a more
reliable way is using a trapdoor one-way function. This basically is the same thing but it has a special
"trapdoor" or a secret key that makes it possible for you to easily compute the other way around aswell.</p>
<p>- One-Way Hash Functions are used as a function that converts variable-length input string into a fixed len
gth output string</p>

## HASHCAT

</p>
<p>Above is a picture where i downloaded hashcat and created a new directory</p>
<p>I had problems downloading wget and i could not continue after this. I could not find a
working command for it. But if i would have get it i wouldve followed the instructions in Teros page.</p>
